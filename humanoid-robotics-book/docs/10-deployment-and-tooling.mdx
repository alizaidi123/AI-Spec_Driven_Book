# Deployment and Tooling for Humanoid Robotics

Deployment involves transitioning from development to real-world operation. This chapter covers deployment strategies, tooling, and practical considerations for deploying humanoid robots.

## Physics Simulation Environments

Simulation is crucial for testing and development:

- **Gazebo**: Popular open-source simulation with realistic physics
- **PyBullet**: Fast physics simulation with Python interface
- **Mujoco**: Advanced physics simulation (commercial)
- **Webots**: Robot simulation software with built-in tools

```python
# Example simulation environment setup
import pybullet
import pybullet_data

class SimulationEnvironment:
    def __init__(self, gui=True):
        if gui:
            self.physics_client = pybullet.connect(pybullet.GUI)
        else:
            self.physics_client = pybullet.connect(pybullet.DIRECT)

        pybullet.setAdditionalSearchPath(pybullet_data.getDataPath())
        pybullet.setGravity(0, 0, -9.81)

    def load_robot(self, urdf_path):
        robot_id = pybullet.loadURDF(urdf_path, [0, 0, 1])
        return robot_id

    def step_simulation(self):
        pybullet.stepSimulation()
```

## Simulation-to-Reality Transfer Techniques

Bridging the gap between simulation and real-world performance:

- **Domain randomization**: Training with varied simulation parameters
