# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-08
**Feature**: specs/1-book-spec/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed validation
- Specification includes all requested elements: target audience (5 bullets), learning goals (7 goals), and 10-chapter outline with key topics
- All 10 required domains covered: embodiment, sensors and actuators, control, locomotion, manipulation, perception, learning, safety, simulation, deployment
